# Code of Conduct
The Graph community is the heart and soul that drives the network, and the Graph Advocates are community leaders. To sustain a thriving community, all members should aim to foster a welcoming and productive environment. Graph Advocates must read and follow the policies and guidelines contained in this Code of Conduct. By participating, Advocates are acknowledging and agreeing to the terms of this Code of Conduct. In addition to the policies and guidelines described below, Advocates are expected to act lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interest of The Graph ecosystem and its participants.

This Code of Conduct offers policies and guidelines that help Advocates conduct themselves appropriately when contributing to the Graph Advocates’ program, and ensures that The Graph community welcomes and supports individuals from all across the world.

Any violation of the policies or guidelines contained in this Code of Conduct can result in removal from Graph Advocates’ program.

## Purpose and Scope
The policies and guidelines outlined in this Code of Conduct establish the expectations related to the conduct of participants in Graph Advocates’ program, whether online or offline. This Code extends to, but is not limited to:

Any activities or contributions made as an Advocate in the Graph Advocates’ program;
The interactions with any members of The Graph ecosystem or interactions with the public about The Graph ecosystem;
Any communications in The Graph social networks or related forums, person-to-person correspondence, mailing lists, websites, private forums, online chats or messaging, or social media posts;
Conduct at any online or in-person events, conferences, training, or workshops;
The creation of, or assisting others in creating, audio, visual, written, digital, or print material.

# The Ethos of Graph Advocates

Advocates are critical to The Graph ecosystem and have the opportunity to make contributions that will shape the future of web3. Advocates understand the unique nature of their role and how their efforts will directly impact The Graph, their local community, the web3 community, and the future of The Graph ecosystem.

## Advocate Participation

Advocates are eager to proactively contribute to The Graph community, grow network adoption and develop the ecosystem. They make regular, high-quality, and meaningful contributions based on their interests and expertise. Advocates are kind and supportive, and they seek out opportunities to help others, including fellow Advocates, subgraph users, network participants, and other community members. The Graph community is decentralized with different kinds of contributors. Advocates are community leaders and should continuously participate in community activities.

Advocates are expected to make minimum contributions including but not limited to:

- **Event Evangelist**: Host or assist a minimum of one (1) event per quarter and attend a minimum of one (1) event per month.
Content Creator: Create a minimum of one (1) piece of content per month.
- **Text Translator**: Translate a minimum of 500 words per week and two (2) social media posts per week.
Community Care: Assist in Telegram, Reddit, or Discord for a minimum of two (2) hours per week.
- **Technical Teacher**: Contribute one or more of the following: assist in Telegram, Reddit, or Discord a minimum of two (2) hours per week, or conduct one (1) workshop per quarter, or create one (1) piece of educational content per quarter.
- **Web3 Welcomer**: Introduce a minimum of one (1) new individual, team, or organization to The Graph or web3 per quarter, or be a panelist/speaker at a minimum of one (1) web3 event (online or in-person) per quarter.

Advocates are encouraged to contribute more than the minimum expectations of the Advocates Program, and the community should feel empowered to reward any efforts above and beyond the minimum expectations of an Advocate with a grant for their efforts.

## Advocate Conduct

**ACT WITH INTEGRITY**

Advocates maintain high standards of integrity. Advocates shall not engage in: misleading communications, knowingly sharing false information, intellectual property or copyright infringement or unauthorized disclosure, or misrepresentation.

Advocates will have intellectual integrity. Advocates will not plagiarize the work of others; they will properly cite, quote, give credit, and/or provide access to the original source(s) of information they use, whether they are paraphrasing or simply restating the work of another, no matter the type of content.

Advocates will avoid representing a business or organization, including discussing its products or services, without disclosing any relevant employment, affiliations, or any compensation or benefits received by the company. Any endorsements or promotions must reflect the honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences of the Advocate. Advocates may not misrepresent any organization as having a relationship or affiliation with The Graph or other ecosystem partners, or create the appearance of such.

When providing information about other participants or stakeholder groups in the protocol, Advocates will maintain a fair and balanced opinion. For example, rather than suggesting specific Indexers to delegate with, or specific subgraphs to curate, which could be construed as endorsements, Advocates will provide general resources and educational materials when helping others. Advocates understand how a fair and balanced opinion supports decentralization.

Advocates are prohibited from acting in their capacity as Advocates for solicitation or marketing, personal gain, or gain for any other project.

**MAINTAIN PROFESSIONALISM**

Advocates act professionally, including when collecting feedback, criticism, or during times of disagreement. Advocates may not engage in, without limitation: name-calling, hate speech, discrimination of any kind, verbal harassment, insults, highly sarcastic speech, rude remarks or comments; using emotionally charged language or tone; being disruptive to the ecosystem; using inappropriate language, including obscenities or sexually explicit material(s), video, images, or audio; engaging in trivial or unnecessary arguments; and inciting violence or threats towards others or self. Advocates always use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice, while respecting others’ right to privacy.

**BE RESOURCEFUL**

Advocates understand their abilities as well as limitations, and they find appropriate ways to navigate through different situations. If an Advocate has questions or is unable to utilize the resources around them, it is their responsibility to reach out to domain experts, ecosystem partners, or other Advocates for assistance.

**PRICE TALK**

The Advocates Program is intended to support The Graph ecosystem through the development of high-quality content and community contributions. It is not a forum for speculation, price discussion, or financial or investment advice of any kind. In addition to creating legal and regulatory challenges, price talk generally lowers the quality of community discourse, and shifts the focus away from the core contributions The Graph is making toward the decentralized world. Accordingly, Advocates do not participate in communications, discussions, or promotion of anything related to the price of the GRT token. Examples of price talk include, but are not limited to: price speculation, general price talk, technical analysis of GRT charts, shilling, commentary about market caps, supply issuance and inflation, exchange listings, or OTC offers or requests.

**NON-DISPARAGEMENT**

Advocates create a collaborative community where topics can be discussed openly and respectfully, without making disparaging comments. Advocates are expected to avoid making defamatory, inappropriate or harmful comments, content, or any other material about other Advocates, Graph AdvocatewsDAO, The Graph, ecosystem partners, or any other participants in the community. Advocates should not take any action which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect The Graph or its ecosystem partners. Constructive criticism is best shared in private channels.


## Intellectual Property and Copyright

Advocates respect the intellectual property rights of The Graph, its contractors, other Advocates, members of The Graph’s ecosystem, as well as those of any and all external parties.

The Graph may request that Advocates remove any content or material that is found to violate the policies or guidelines in this Code of Conduct, intellectual property rights, federal or state laws or regulations, or local ordinances.

Advocates are prohibited from taking or damaging property (intellectual or physical), information, services, or accounts belonging to The Graph or other Advocates. If an Advocate does not return misuses, improperly shares, or pirates property belonging to The Graph or others, or violates their privacy rights (for example, by recording conversations without notice, whether online or offline), the Advocate could be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including legal action and/or removal from the Advocates Program.

It is considered a violation of the Code of Conduct when an Advocate:

- Uses electronic or other devices to make audio, photographic, screenshot, or video records of a person(s) without prior knowledge or permission;
- Records, stores, shares, or distributes unauthorized recording of personal conversations, images, meetings, or activities;
- Creates, stores, shares, or distributes the created likeness of any person(s) without prior knowledge or permission. This includes, but is not limited to, emojis, gifs, and memes.
- Please note: Screenshots may be taken and used for the purpose of reporting behavioral concerns to Graph AdvocatesDAO.

Advocates are responsible for maintaining the appropriate security of their own property or any property of The Graph’s provided to Advocates as part of the Advocates Program.

## Violations

In the event of alleged misconduct, members of the DAO’s Advocate Committee will work together to determine if the behavior is a violation of the Code of Conduct. If it is determined that there is an alleged violation, the committee will notify the Advocate(s) accused, and gather information about the incident(s).

Advocates are expected to assist in the implementation and adherence of this Code of Conduct by reporting any violations. Any reported violations and/or complaints will be handled confidentially. If an Advocate is found to be responsible for any violation of this Code of Conduct, the Advocate will be formally notified.

Any violation of the policies or guidelines contained in this Code of Conduct can result in removal from The Graph’s Advocates program and/or Graph AdvocatesDAO.

The Graph AdvocatesDAO reserves the right to immediately remove an Advocate from the Graph Advocates program and/or Graph AdvocatesDAO without notice or opportunity for a hearing for behavior deemed to be severely disruptive to the ecosystem, the Graph Advocates program, Graph AdvocatesDAO, or this Code of Conduct, or that is extremely inconsistent with The Graph’s mission, values, and goals.

Violations can be reported to info@graphadvocates.com.
