# Roles

Becoming an Advocate offers flexibility: Advocates can focus on different roles in the community based on their interests and abilities. Echoing The Graph communityâ€™s vision of an internet without gatekeepers, Advocates of all walks of life are encouraged to pursue what motivates them. There are currently six different Advocate roles to embody:

## Event Evangelist

Proactively host and participate in The Graph events (online or in-person), and attend regional industry events.

## Content Creator

Create original content related to The Graph or web3, such as articles, video, infographics, memes or GIFs, how-to guides, animations, and many other creative materials.

## Text Translator

Translate The Graph documentation or other community materials into other languages.

## Community Care

Look out for the community, share content, answer community questions, or provide directions to additional resources, posted in The Graph's Telegram, Forum, Discord, or Reddit channels.

## Technical Teacher

Educate others on how to use or build subgraphs, participate in The Graph Network, and coach community members on how they can best contribute to The Graph.

## Web3 Welcomer

Facilitate the adoption of The Graph, speak or present at conferences, and introduce people to The Graph and web3.
