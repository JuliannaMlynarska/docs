# Overview

Grantees are the centerpiece of our community and an important source to keep The Graph ecosystem growing. In this section, Grantees will be able to showcase the product of their work they have passion for, and for which they received a community grant from the Graph AdvocatesDAO. Whether your grant is completed, in-progress or running on a continuous basis, everyone is welcome to promote their contributions in the Grant Showroom sections.





More content to come following the launch of the Graph AdvocatesDAO. Stay tuned!
